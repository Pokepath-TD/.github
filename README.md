![Pokepath TD Hero](https://pokepathtd.app/imgs/features/logo.webp "Pokepath TD gameplay")

[Pokepath TD](https://pokepathtd.app/) is a free browser tower defense that blends tactical team building with an exciting mid-wave evolution mechanic. Across nine distinct routes, each map presents unique enemy compositions and layouts that reward thoughtful placement, type matchups, and unit synergies. Instead of only relying on passive upgrades, players spend coins during waves to level units and trigger evolutions at pivotal moments, creating dramatic power spikes and meaningful choices under pressure.

The game strikes a careful balance between accessibility and depth. New players can jump in quickly thanks to an intuitive interface, clear controls, and a concise tutorial flow. More experienced players will find deeper systems to master: branching upgrade trees, collectible shiny variants for completionists, and route-specific strategies that encourage experimentation. Auto Mode and speed-up options support AFK farming, letting you make steady progress even when you can't actively play.

Quality-of-life features make long-term play comfortable. You can export and import save files for backups, enabling safe cross-device play and recovery; a built-in save system persists progression between runs so unlocking upgrades feels rewarding. Performance Mode and low-graphics options keep the game playable on a wide range of devices. Keyboard shortcuts and quick-slot bindings streamline routine actions for players who like efficient, repeatable runs.

Whether you want a short strategic session or a long-term progression grind, [Pokepath TD](https://pokepathtd.app/) offers a satisfying loop of planning, reaction, and growth. Choose a route, assemble a team that complements the map, and time your upgrades and evolutions to turn the tide of battle. With free in-browser access and optional desktop builds for stability, it’s easy to try and hard to put down.

## Quick Start
- Choose one of the 9 routes and study its enemy waves.  
- Build a team around type synergy and optimal placement.  
- Spend coins mid-wave to level or evolve units for power spikes.  
- Use Auto Mode for AFK farming and export saves regularly.

## Tips & Strategy

### Beginner Tips
- Learn the nine route layouts early — knowing chokepoints and safe placement tiles is half the battle.  
- Use quick slots (0–9) to place units faster and avoid misclicks during tense waves.  
- Start with balanced types (attack, tank, support) until you understand route-specific threats.

### Team Composition & Synergy
- Prioritize type synergies and buffs (area buffs, attack speed, recharge) over stacking a single high-DPS unit.  
- Include at least one unit that counters common wave threats (e.g., high-armor or flying enemies) for the route.  
- Experiment: some cross-type combos unlock surprising power — try different box Pokémon on stubborn maps.

### Mid-wave Evolution Timing
- Save coins for pivotal waves where evolving a unit or leveling twice creates a decisive power spike.  
- Avoid evolving too early on small waves; aim to evolve when the unit will affect multiple enemy waves or the boss.  
- If a wave includes a boss, prioritize evolution that increases sustained DPS or survivability.

### Route & Boss Tips
- Scout earlier waves to anticipate late-wave spikes (e.g., heavy armor or fast flyers) and adapt your placements.  
- For boss encounters, focus on survivability (tanks + healing/support) and single-target DPS; aoe is useful for minion waves.

### AFK Farming & Auto Mode
- Use Auto Mode for repeatable farming runs; set up a tested automatic composition before enabling AFK.  
- Combine Auto with speed-up to maximize farming efficiency; monitor the first few runs to ensure the setup holds.

### Save Management & Performance
- Export saves regularly (Export in menu) to back up progress — especially before updates or long sessions.  
- Enable Performance/Low Graphics mode on lower-end devices to reduce lag during high-wave runs.

### Advanced Tactics
- Learn which units benefit most from critical timing (e.g., recharge reduction + attack speed) and prioritize those upgrades.  
- Use keyboard shortcuts for rapid sells/placements during late-game frenzy waves.
